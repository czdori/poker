POKER

--- disclaimer: not all of the code is written by me! some of it was part of the lesson, but about 80-90% is my own work. ---

This is a program representing a game of poker. 

First, it deals out the cards according to the number of players (numhands) and the number of cards for each (n). Cards are represented with a 2-character string: their value (2-9, T for 10, JQKA) and their color (S,H,D,C). 

Next, there's card_ranks which, obviously, ranks the cards in a hand, returning an ordered list of their values, regardless of color. The only tricky thing is that if we have cards like 2, 3, 4, 5 and an ace, it counts as a straight because here the A is not valued the highest, but 1. We took care of this in the return statement.

The hand_rank function has some helper functions: two of them decide if the hand is a straight (the values are consecutive of each other) or a flush (they are the same suit), then there's two_pair, and kind, which helps in deciding if the hand's rank is n-of-a-kind. There's an alternative for this function, a little bit more elegant.

The best_wild_hand and the replacement functions allow us to play with jokers in the deck! They find the best possible replacement for us.

Now it's time to actually play the game! The poker function announces the winning hands (and the allmax function makes it possible that identical hands are all returned).
